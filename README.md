# Gramiksha
Gramiksha is a non-profit organisation registered under M.P. Society Act, 1973. We believe that all children are deserving of an empowering childhood and equal opportunities. We work to enhance the quality of education in the government schools by assisting them with learning models that encourage critical thinking, equip students with practical knowledge and help in their overall development. We hope to strengthen the public education system and cultivate a culture conducive to learning and growth.  Gramiksha mobilises the youth and is comprised of like-minded young professionals and students who believe in actualizing this dream. What began as a small initiative for change in 2011 in a village near Gwalior has transformed today into a growing and thriving community across six cities; Bhopal, Delhi, Indore, Gwalior, Jaipur and Laxmangarh.


## Problem Statement
As our volunteers go in different schools to teach, it becomes very difficult for us to keep track of the attendance of volunteers, students on paper, assesment marks, maintain the session record sheet,etc.
We will be needing an application in which we can do the following things:

1. Maintain Volunteer attendance
2. Maintain Student attendance
3. Session record sheet for volunteers
5. Use google Api and pin point schools
6. Display past achievements
